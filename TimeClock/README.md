# TimeClock

The origin idea to display the current time on the main window and bind the time properly to `MainWindow`.

The class `VisualTime` shows the `CurrentTime` and the derived `DisplayDate` and `DisplayTime`.
The `NotifyProperyChanged` learned that all the derived properties updated to set the 'ProperName' an empty name.

After some time was `StringFormat` in WPF better the derived properties.

### Keywords
- Binding with StringFormat.
- INotifyProperyChanged.
- Timer() class.
